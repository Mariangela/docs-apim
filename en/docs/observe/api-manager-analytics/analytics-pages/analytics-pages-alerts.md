# Alerts Page
This page shows information related to business alerts issued by APIM analytics for your currently selected
 environment and organization. You can use this page as a health monitoring dashboard and make it visible to your project 
  team. Using this page you can drilldown on each alert and discover possible anomalies or errors in your published
   APIs. See the topics given below to get details of the available widgets and understand how to use them to best effect.
    
## Prerequisites
To use this page, be sure to configure alerts and have API invocations that trigger alerts. Refer 
[this]({{base_path}}/observe/api-manager-analytics/configure-analytics/configure-alerts) documentation to configure
 alerts for your API. 

!!! Tip
     By default, alerts are not enabled for API analytics.
